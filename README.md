# Quote Vote

Quote.Vote is a text-first platform for public dialogue,  
where every post becomes a space for quoting, reflecting, and voting on ideas.  

Contributors from around the world helped build this civic engagement toolâ€”  
without ads or algorithms, we can have transparent conversation.  

Features such as targeted feedback via text highlights, public chat threads,  
and voting mechanics support thoughtful interaction over reactive engagement.  

Originally prototyped as Scoreboard, the project is now in preparation for open-source  
and our team welcomes remix, reuse, and contributions from developers, designers,  
and democratic technologists alike.
